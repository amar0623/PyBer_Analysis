# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose
The Pyber ride-sharing company collected data that was used to analyze the relationship between types of cities, number of drivers and riders, percentage of total fares, and number of drivers and riders per city. The visualization of this analysis is used to determine affordability of the service in underserved neighborhoods.

## Results
Due to density of population differences, it makes sense that the urban areas will have more total rides, drivers, and fares than a less-dense rural area. The rural areas pay more per ride, and the drivers make more as well. In rural areas, there is a higher demand for drivers compared to the total rides, therefore their drivers will receive more money. In the urban areas, total drivers supersedes the amount of rides, therefore the drivers will make less money. View the dataframe below for an easy comparison of the numbers:

While rural drivers may make more per individual ride, rural driving is less profitable per year. In the line chart below, you can see that while each city type has similar peaks and valleys throughout the year, the earning potential for rural drivers is severely limited due to the lack of need for drivers.

### Recommendations
From a business perspective, it may become more profitable to limit the number of urban drivers. This will help raise the demand amongst a smaller pool of drivers, increasing fares for drivers and bringing more profit to the company.
In rural areas, offering incentives for riders (such as discount codes or a rewards system) may help drum up business and make rural areas more profitable.
Urban areas may also want to set a fare baseline. The average fare per driver is $16, which is less than half of the suburban fare. In urban areas, there's typically more traffic than suburban or rural areas, which means ride times will be increased (for pick-up, the ride, and drop-off). Setting a baseline fare fee will help alleviate disparity for drivers fares and bring more profit to the company.
